There are a lot of businesses named B&H in NYC. B&H Dairy on 2nd Ave; Boris & Horton, the cafe, where I'm sitting now; and B&H Photo and Video, just to name a few exampled. Is there a running joke?
I did my second muscle-up ever today. Soon I'll be able to do so on demand! For now, it requires a conspiracy of perfect conditions: I must have just finished a run and yet have my hands not too sweaty.
