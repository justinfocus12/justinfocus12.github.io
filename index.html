            <h2> About me </h2>
            <p> I am an applied mathematician and aspiring climate scientist. I recently completed a PhD in Computational and Applied Mathematics <a href="https://cam.uchicago.edu" target="_blank">(CAM)</a> at the University of Chicago, and in September 2022 began a Postdoctoral position at MIT in the department of <a href="https://eapsweb.mit.edu">Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences</a>. My supervisor is <a href="https://pog.mit.edu">Paul O'Gorman</a>. I study the dynamics and predictability of extreme weather events and climate tipping points, using frameworks and methods borrowed from computational chemistry. In particular, I am working on developing rare event sampling methods for extreme precipitation events. 
            My primary PhD advisor was <a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/~weare/" target="_blank">Jonathan Weare</a> at NYU's Courant Institute. Additionally, I also collaborate with <a href="https://math.nyu.edu/people/profiles/GERBER_Edwin.html" target="_blank">Edwin Gerber</a> (also at Courant), <a href="https://geosci.uchicago.edu/people/dorian-abbot/" target="_blank">Dorian Abbot</a> in UChicago Geophysical Sciences, <a href="https://stat.uchicago.edu/~msilber/" target="_blank">Mary Silber</a> in UChicago CAM, and <a href="https://chemistry.uchicago.edu/faculty/aaron-dinner" target="_blank">Aaron Dinner</a> in UChicago chemistry. </p>
            <p> Extreme weather events and climate tipping points are enormously consequential, but very hard to study through direct simulation, precisely because they are rare. My overarching goal is to get the most out of the available data by combining dynamical insight, numerical simulation, and data-driven machine learning methods to characterize extreme events. My PhD focused on Sudden Stratospheric Warming <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/enso/sudden-stratospheric-warming-and-polar-vortex-early-2021">(SSW)</a>, a spectacular breakdown of the stratospheric polar vortex that can wreak havoc on the <a href="pages/random/index.html#chicago_winter">Chicago winter</a>. SSWs are rare, sudden, and hard to predict. Using transition path theory and Markov state models, we are establishing concrete metrics of risk, predictability, and variability of SSW events across a hierarchy of models. I am looking forward to exploring other areas of atmospheric science, in particular extreme precipitation and heat waves.</p>
            <p> I had the great fortune to be supported by the initiative on <a href="https://climategrandchallenges.mit.edu/">Climate Grand Challenges</a> at MIT. During graduate school, I was supported by the Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellowship <a href="https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/">(DOE CSGF)</a></p>
