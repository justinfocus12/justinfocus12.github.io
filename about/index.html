    I'm in the fourth year of the PhD program in Computational and Applied Mathematics (CAM) at the University of Chicago. I'm in the first cohort of this program and I've had the privilege of "trail-blazing" with lots of freedom to collaborate with a variety of fields. I apply methods of statistical mechanics, originally developed for molecular simulation, to study climate dynamics, specifically extreme events.
